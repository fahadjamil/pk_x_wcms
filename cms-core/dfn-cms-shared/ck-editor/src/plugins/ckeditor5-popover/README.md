# CKPro Popover

[CKPro Popover](https://topiqs.online/1125) is a 3. party commercial plugin for creating popovers & tooltips in CKEditor 5.

CKPro Popover is a smooth working plugin that makes it easy for content creators to append short additional information to words, ideas or concepts presented in the main CKEditor document allowing readers to access that additional information on mouse hover.

CKPro Popover works much like Bootstrap Popover and in fact Bootstrap Popover can be used to build the Popover UX on the result side.
